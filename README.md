# Quirky Personal Portfolio ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

This is a uniquely designed **personal portfolio website** that presents information about me through a quirky, playful user interface.  
It was created **prior to the widespread use of AI tools** and before my time as a CS student, showcasing my early experimentation with frontend design and interactive UI patterns.

To get it up and running, simply clone the repo, run `npm install`, and then `npm run dev`. The site will start locally (usually at `http://localhost:5173/`) where you can explore the unconventional layout, interactive elements, and playful styling that make this portfolio stand out.

The project is built with **React** using **Vite** for fast development and bundling, **TypeScript** for type safety, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. This stack allows for a highly responsive, modern, and visually engaging experience while still reflecting the experimental spirit of my early frontend work.
